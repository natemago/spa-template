# spa-template

Template for a SPA that relies on the latest standards implemented in the browsers (basically Chrome), and ES6/JavaScript support.
It does not use any traspilers (Babel/TypeScript). This also means no building tools (webpack and such).



# Roadmap

Base goals:

* MVC/MVVM/MVA/MVP based (to be decided)
  * ECB based (to be decided)
* View based on WebComponents
* HTML Templates
* Routing using history API
* Shadow DOM for rendering (to be decided)
* Styling with latest standards of CSS3
